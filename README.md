# :tada: Want to start your journey in Open Source?! :tada:
I made this for anyone who wants to start but is frustrated by the fact that "good first issues" aren't always beginner-friendly, based on my experience so far.

## If you're confused about how to get started, watch this quick, straight-to-the-point video: 
[Contributing to Open Source Can Change Your Life - Here’s How to Do It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML6vfKjQss)

## Here are the steps to follow to contribute to this project:
1. Fork this repo
2. Navigate to your desktop and clone the repo you just forked 
```
cd desktop 
git clone <url>
cd <repoName>
```
3. Install dependencies! 
`npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`). After you  have installed those, go ahead and install `npm install @picocss/pico`
4. Make a branch and name it whatever you like
```
git branch <branchName>
git checkout <branchName>
```
5. Make changes! 
6. Navigate to **src** folder and then click on the **routes** folder. In there, you should see a file called **contributors.ts**.
7. Add the following code(replace the info with yours of course) in **contributors.ts**
```
// contributors add your code below this line
{
  name: 'Raul',
  github: 'https://github.com/Raulj123'
},
```
8. Run the command below to see your changes.
``` 
npm run dev 
```


9. You're done! Go ahead and push your changes bruh :triumph:


I decided to make this project at 11 PM at night while I was looking for beginner-friendly open source projects. Unfortunately, those are hard to find :disappointed:
