> Created to help newcomers dive into open source more easily, addressing the frustration when "good first issues" aren't beginner-friendly, drawing from my own experience.

## Here's how you can contribute::
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the forked repo to your desktop.
```
cd desktop 
git clone <url>
cd <repoName>
```
3. Install dependencies! 
`npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`). After you  have installed those, go ahead and install `npm install @picocss/pico` and `npm install tailwindcss`
4. Create a branch
```
git branch <branchName>
git checkout <branchName>
```
5. Make changes! 
6. Navigate to **src** directory and then click on the **Data** directory. In there, you should see a file called **contributors.ts**.
7. Add the following code(replace the info with yours of course) in **contributors.ts**
```
// contributors add your code below this line
{
  name: 'Raul',
  github: 'https://github.com/Raulj123'
},
```
8. Run the command below to see your changes.
``` 
npm run dev 
```


9. You're done! Go ahead and push your changes bruh :triumph:


I decided to make this project at 11 PM at night while I was looking for beginner-friendly open source projects. Unfortunately, those are hard to find :disappointed:
